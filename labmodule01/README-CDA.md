# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Lab Module 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

For this module the set up of a virtual sandbox is done to begin testing various modules relevent to the internet of things.
In this readme contains the information on the development of the environment done by following the text provided. 

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

For the virtual environment utilized in these labs there are a few pre-requisites downloading python, java, pip, and git to 
complete the development of our personal workstations. Verifying if pre-installed the versions of the softwares above are 
within regulations described in the text. The next step was to configure the development environment and clone 
the sample source code provided in the textbook. 

How does your implementation work?

The implementation is based in a Linux environment. 

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).


### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)
