# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-GDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Lab Module 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

The purpose of this module is to build a testing environment for intergation / unit testing for internet of things based 
solutions. More specifically in this case creating an environment for Java intergration and Junit testing for the GDA. In 
this github repository any iteration made on the modules will be updated. 

How does your implementation work?

Through the use of git, the java components path wes utilized where pre-existing projects were used to test the validity 
of the testing environment built. The project ran as a java application and through maven install -DskipTests. Using the 
shared repository forked from programmingtheiot/book-exercise-docs the code was altered and pushed to share with all 
members of the group.  

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)
